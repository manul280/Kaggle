Your team should adopt an HCD approach to AI as early as possible - ideally, from when you begin to entertain the possibility of building an AI system. \n\nThe following six steps are intended to help you get started with applying HCD to the design of AI systems. That said, what HCD means for you will depend on your industry, your resources, your organization and the people you seek to serve.\n\n\n## 1. Understand people’s needs to define the problem\nWorking with people to understand the pain points in their current journeys can help find unaddressed needs. This can be done by observing people as they navigate existing tools, conducting interviews, assembling focus groups, reading user feedback and other methods. Your entire team – including data scientists and engineers – should be involved in this step, so that every team member gains an understanding of the people they hope to serve. Your team should include and involve people with diverse perspectives and backgrounds, along race, gender, and other characteristics. Sharpen your problem definition and brainstorm creative and inclusive solutions together.\n\n> A company wants to address the problem of dosage errors for immunosuppressant drugs given to patients after liver transplants. The company starts by observing physicians, nurses and other hospital staff throughout the liver transplant process. It also interviews them about the current dosage determination process - which relies on published guidelines and human judgment - and shares video clips from the interviews with the entire development team. The company also reviews research studies and assembles focus groups of former patients and their families. All team members participate in a freewheeling brainstorming session for potential solutions.

Ask if AI adds value to any potential solution\n\nOnce you are clear about which need you are addressing and how, consider whether AI adds value. \n \n- Would people generally agree that what you are trying to achieve is a good outcome?\n- Would non-AI systems - such as rule-based solutions, which are easier to create, audit and maintain - be significantly less effective than an AI system?\n- Is the task that you are using AI for one that people would find boring, repetitive or otherwise difficult to concentrate on? \n- Have AI solutions proven to be better than other solutions for similar use cases in the past?\n\nIf you answered no to any of these questions, an AI solution may not be necessary or appropriate.\n\n> A disaster response agency is working with first responders to reduce the time it takes to rescue people from disasters, like floods. The time- and labor-intensive human review of drone and satellite photos to find stranded people increases rescue time. Everybody agrees that speeding up photo review would be a good outcome, since faster rescues could save more lives. The agency determines that an AI image recognition system would likely be more effective than a non-AI automated system for this task. It is also aware that AI-based image recognition tools have been applied successfully to review aerial footage in other industries, like agriculture. The agency therefore decides to further explore the possibility of an AI-based solution.","metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":0.005854,"end_time":"2020-12-23T18:50:12.230199","exception":false,"start_time":"2020-12-23T18:50:12.224345","status":"completed"},"tags":[]}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## 3. Consider the potential harms that the AI system could cause\n\nWeigh the benefits of using AI against the potential harms, throughout the design pipeline: from collecting and labeling data, to training a model, to deploying the AI system. Consider the impact on users and on society. Your privacy team can help uncover hidden privacy issues and determine whether privacy-preserving techniques like [differential privacy](https://developers.googleblog.com/2019/09/enabling-developers-and-organizations.html) or [federated learning](https://ai.googleblog.com/2017/04/federated-learning-collaborative.html) may be appropriate. Take steps to reduce harms, including by embedding people - and therefore human judgment - more effectively in data selection, in model training and in the operation of the system. If you estimate that the harms are likely to outweigh the benefits, do not build the system.\n\n> An online education company wants to use an AI system to ‘read’ and automatically assign scores to student essays, while redirecting company staff to double-check random essays and to review essays that the AI system has trouble with. The system would enable the company to quickly get scores back to students. The company creates a harms review committee, which recommends that the system not be built. Some of the major harms flagged by the committee include: the potential for the AI system to pick up bias against certain patterns of language from training data and amplify it (harming people in the groups that use those patterns of language), to encourage students to ‘game’ the algorithm rather than improve their essays and to reduce the classroom role of education experts while increasing the role of technology experts.","metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":0.004235,"end_time":"2020-12-23T18:50:12.238904","exception":false,"start_time":"2020-12-23T18:50:12.234669","status":"completed"},"tags":[]}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## 4. Prototype, starting with non-AI solutions\n\nDevelop a non-AI prototype of your AI system quickly to see how people interact with it. This makes prototyping easier, faster and less expensive.

They should also understand and consent to what they are helping with and how.\n\n> A movie streaming startup wants to use AI to recommend movies to users, based on their stated preferences and viewing history. The team first invites a diverse group of users to share their stated preferences and viewing history with a movie enthusiast, who then recommends movies that the users might like. Based on these conversations and on feedback about which recommended movies users enjoyed, the team changes its approach to how movies are categorized. Getting feedback from a diverse group of users early and iterating often allows the team to improve its product early, rather than making expensive corrections later.

The company has successfully tested its product with a diverse group of people from different ethnicities. Still, it knows that there could be instances in which the video may not properly focus on a person’s face.

Build in safety measures\n\nSafety measures protect users against harm. They seek to limit unintended behavior and accidents, by ensuring that a system reliably delivers high-quality outcomes. This can only be achieved through extensive and continuous evaluation and testing. Design processes around your AI system to continuously monitor performance, delivery of intended benefits, reduction of harms, fairness metrics and any changes in how people are _actually_ using it.\n \nThe kind of safety measures your system needs depends on its purpose and on the types of harms it could cause. Start by reviewing the list of safety measures built into similar non-AI products or services. Then, review your earlier analysis of the potential harms of using AI in your system (see Step 3).\n \nHuman oversight of your AI system is crucial:\n- Create a human ‘red team’ to play the role of a person trying to manipulate your system into unintended behavior. Then, strengthen your system against any such manipulation.\n- Determine how people in your organization can best monitor the system’s safety once it is live. \n- Explore ways for your AI system to quickly alert a human when it is faced with a challenging case.\n- Create ways for users and others to flag potential safety issues.\n \n> To bolster the safety of its product, a company that develops a widely-used AI-enabled voice assistant creates a permanent internal ‘red team’ to play the role of bad actors that want to manipulate the voice assistant. The red team develops adversarial inputs to fool the voice assistant. The company then uses ‘adversarial training’ to guard the product against similar adversarial inputs, improving its safety.","metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":0.004172,"end_time":"2020-12-23T18:50:12.264808","exception":false,"start_time":"2020-12-23T18:50:12.260636","status":"completed"},"tags":[]}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Learn more\n\nTo dive deeper into the application of HCD to AI, check out these resources:\n\n* Lex Fridman’s [introductory lecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmjamLZ3v8A) on Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence\n* Google’s People + AI Research (PAIR) [Guidebook](https://pair.withgoogle.com/guidebook/)\n* Stanford Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence (HAI) [research](https://hai.stanford.edu/research)\n\n# Your turn\nIn the exercise, you will **[use HCD to navigate issues](https://www.kaggle.com/kernels/fork/15577437)** in AI system design scenarios.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"---\n\n\n\n\n*Have questions or comments?
